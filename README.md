Cross-platform scouting app for the FIRST Robotics Competition

## Getting Started

This project needs Flutter and the Android SDK installed in order to compile. I would also recommend vscode with the flutter plugin.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to tensor_programming on github for a lot of the boilerplate Firebase auth code.
