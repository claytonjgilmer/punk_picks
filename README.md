Cross-platform scouting app for the FIRST Robotics Competition

## Getting Started

This project needs Flutter and the Android SDK installed in order to compile. I would also recommend vscode with the flutter plugin.

## Special Thanks

Uses the CounterFormField, NumberFormField, and a couple other design decisions (scouting model structure) from dhall1's ScoutingApp project.
